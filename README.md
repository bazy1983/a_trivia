# Trivia Quiz
This project was aimed toward using time delay functions, like setTimeout and setInterval, and use the asynchronously with other events and functions in the project.
I also wanted to get a starting point to JSON and AJAX to get more comfortable about these technologies.
I made this project scalable in terms of questions being asked. the user can edit the data file and change, add, and or remove and questions and the page will behave accordingly. It will loop through all the question no mater how much questions are there in the data file.
